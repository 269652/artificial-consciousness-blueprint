Design goals
Represent affect as structured, trainable latent states (not just tags).

Let affect both:
Downstream-modulate: sensory attention, parsing, candidate scoring, memory consolidation, action selection.

Upstream-influence: neuromodulator production/release (e.g., OXT for love/empathy), receptor setpoints, and homeostatic targets.

Close the loop with interpretable, machine-checkable signals and guardrails to prevent runaway feedback.
