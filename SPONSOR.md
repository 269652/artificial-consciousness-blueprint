# Sponsorship & Funding Framework
Purpose: Provide transparent, staged allocation plans for external funding; ensure every dollar advances empirical validation, safety, and scalable emergence research while preserving openness.

## Guiding Principles
- Scientific Integrity: All core algorithmic results reproducible (seeds, configs, metrics artifacts).
- Open First: Core research code, metrics schemas, and ablation reports remain permissively licensed (unless clearly demarcated applied extensions).
- Measurable Milestones: Advancement tied to Implementation Phases (see `ImplementationPhases.md`).
- Safety & Ethics: No phenomenological suffering simulation; strong instrumentation of drift, stability, and constraint adherence.
- Transparent Accounting: Monthly public ledger (cloud spend, GPU hours, personnel effort %, experiment counts).

## Tier Overview

| 3 | > 500K – 3M | Formal startup build-out (core team) | Phases 0–16 + multi-seed robustness suite |
| 4 | > 3M – 10M | Scaling emergence experiments | Large-scale multi-agent, long-horizon emergence runs |
| 5 | > 10M | Dedicated AC Research Lab | Institutional lab + commercialization pathways |

- Security: Principle of least privilege, isolated simulation networks, reproducible environment hashes.
- Ethical Safeguards: No training objectives optimizing for simulated suffering, mandatory human review for novel emergent behaviors.

If you are considering Tier 3+ strategic funding, please preface outreach with intended focus (e.g., emergence scaling, safety auditing, commercialization synergy) to streamline alignment.

Together we can turn a formal blueprint into a rigorously evaluated, instrumented step toward functional artificial self‑modelling—while maintaining openness, safety, and scientific credibility.
