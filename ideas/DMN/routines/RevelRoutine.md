# Step R — Revel-gated subroutine (affect-driven autobiographical savoring with real-time serotonergic upregulation)

Purpose:
Allow the DMN to intentionally “revel” in positively tagged autobiographical content (e.g., love, beauty, gratitude), amplifying similar affect and stabilizing cognition by upregulating serotonergic (and allied) tone via an emitter-side osteosteric receptor pathway that boosts release rates in real time, while keeping safety, conservation, and identity-coherence guarantees.

Entry conditions (gate):
- CFG guard: DMN idle/low exteroceptive demand OR explicit user/agent intent to revel.
- Neuromodulators: 5HT moderate→high, NE low→moderate (favor safety/relaxation), DA not spiking (avoid impulsive novelty surges).
- Safety: no pending hazards, no recent instability events (safety_penalty below threshold).
- Budget: reserve time/compute window and clamp max μ excursions and dμ/dt.

Inputs:
- Active μ snapshot and affect state A (empathy, beauty, joy, gratitude).
- z_self summary and autobiographical narrative embedding refs.
- MemoryGraph indices for positively tagged episodes: tags ∈ {love, beauty, gratitude, safety, prosocial}.
- Visionary Memory neighbors aligned with identity and safety.
- Emitter states (e.g., Raphe 5HT pools, VTA DA pools, LC NE pools).
- PHM (Projection Homeostasis Modulator) and PMH-OR (Projection Modulator Homeostasis – Osteosteric Receptor) parameters and caps.

Substeps:

1) Curate revel set (memory selection)
   - Query episodic + narrative nodes with tags {love, beauty, gratitude, prosocial, awe}.
   - Rank by identity_alignment, safety_margin, narrative_coherence.
   - reason(): if identity drift risk is detected, bias toward recent, stable chapters; exclude unresolved contradictions; cap set size to avoid ruminative loops.

2) Assemble savoring playlist (temporal choreography)
   - Order selected memories for gentle escalation: calm → warm → peak → gentle fade.
   - Insert micro-pauses for introspective breath and interleaving current-sensory grounding.
   - reason(): optimize for low NE, steady 5HT uplift, minimal DA spikes; ensure return path to baseline.

3) Bind workspace and prime affect
   - Bind b_t with curated memory embeddings, self-model anchors, and soft visual/auditory cues (if available).
   - Set affect targets: A_target = {empathy↑, beauty↑, gratitude↑}.
   - reason(): if HA/ORX trends toward sleep, shorten session and prevent drowsiness overshoot.

4) Emitter-side osteosteric priming (PMH-OR activation)
   - For Raphe (serotonin), compute receptor activation signal r_5HT via PMH-OR:
     r_5HT = f_osteo(memory_affect_signature, identity_alignment, safety_margin, A_target)
   - For OXT adjunct (optional prosocial co-tone), compute r_OXT similarly with stricter safety caps.
   - reason(): prohibit DA-led co-activation unless identity_coherence and safety very high; suppress NE unless grounding is needed.

5) PHM scaling and outflux shaping
   - PHM computes scaling s_ij^n and ramps r_j^n for edges from emitters to target areas (DMN core, vmPFC, HC, TPJ, etc.).
   - Increase Raphe outflux: Out_5HT = base_outflux_5HT · (1 + κ · r_5HT), bounded by:
     - pool cap (large but finite), dμ/dt ramp, area ceilings, and safety clamps (5HT ceilings_j, ramps).
   - reason(): keep μ_j within bands; prioritize routes to areas supporting autobiographical integration and top-down safety.

6) Projection and binding loop (short epochs)
   - For each epoch (e.g., 200–500 ms):
     - Apply scaled 5HT projection along PHM-weighted edges (top-k routes).
     - Bind at targets via local receptor densities; update μ_j with smooth ramp.
     - Present/refresh the next memory in the savoring playlist; softly augment imagery/text cues.
     - reason(): if NE rises (intrusive urgency), insert grounding cues, narrow playlist, reduce 5HT ramp.

7) Affect feedback and closed-loop control
   - Measure online markers: coherence gain ΔC, uncertainty drop ΔH, safety_penalty, identity drift Δz_self, flow continuity.
   - Adjust r_5HT (and r_OXT if used), and PHM scaling s_ij^5HT in real time to track A_target while minimizing volatility.
   - reason(): if safety_penalty ticks up or ΔC drops below floor, gracefully step down outflux before advancing the playlist.

8) Ceiling enforcement and conservation
   - Enforce per-area ceilings: μ_j[5HT] ≤ ceil_j^5HT; rate limit dμ/dt ≤ r_j^5HT.
   - Respect emitter-side pool and energy cost regularizers; log spillover and saturation; back-off if spillover detected.
   - reason(): apply brief refractory period on any area that hits ceiling to prevent oscillations.

9) Gentle DA/OXT harmonics (optional, gated)
   - If prosocial/eudaimonic tone is stable and safety margins are healthy:
     - Allow minimal OXT co-uptick to reinforce prosocial bonding.
     - Allow modest DA steady baseline (not bursts) to support positive reinforcement of autobiographical value.
   - reason(): avoid DA peaks; any sign of novelty chase → clamp DA to baseline and continue 5HT-led stabilization.

10) Session taper and reintegration
    - Taper 5HT ramps linearly/exponentially to baseline; insert a final grounding memory that connects present context to positive identity themes.
    - Write a brief narrative “savoring summary” and link it to the visited episodes (tracked_by edges).
    - reason(): ensure re-entry has normal μ profile and confidence; schedule micro-review to consolidate.

11) Safety and anti-rumination guards
    - Max session duration, max μ excursion, ruminative pattern detector (repetition without ΔC/ΔH gains).
    - Immediate abort path on coherence collapse, rising safety_penalty, or identity drift flags.
    - reason(): on abort, route to PFC-2 stabilization routine or to calming breath/grounding micro-loop.

12) Learning and PHM updates
    - Attribute improvements (ΔC, ΔH, reduced safety_penalty, flow continuity) to PHM edge scalings and r_5HT decisions via eligibility traces.
    - Update PHM critics/actors to reproduce stable uplift with lower energy and fewer oscillations.
    - Update receptor/homeostasis priors for future revel sessions (smarter ceilings/ramps).

Outputs:
- Stabilized μ with 5HT-led uplift across selected areas (bounded).
- Updated memory links (savoring summary, strengthened prosocial/beauty associations).
- PHM and receptor model gradients for improved future control.
- Ready-to-reenter packet with normal budgets, safety flags cleared, and elevated A consistent with identity.

Interfaces and knobs (minimal API):
- revel.start(intent_tags=[love, beauty, gratitude], duration_s, μ_ceils, ramps, safety_floor)
- revel.step(b_t, metrics) → control {r_5HT, s_ij^5HT, edge_topk}
- revel.stop() → taper and write narrative
- Policy parameters: κ gain, max Δμ/session, refractory windows, anti-rumination thresholds

Notes:
- This is a savoring—not stimulation—routine: prioritize gentle, steady 5HT uplift with strict DA/NE controls.
- The large Raphe pool is bounded in practice by PHM ramp/ceilings and receptor saturation; always log utilization to avoid hidden debt.
- Tie the playlist to identity-coherent, prosocial, and safe episodes to prevent maladaptive reinforcement.
