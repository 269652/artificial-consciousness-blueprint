# Autobiographical Narrative vs. Autoreflective Personality View

Goal: distill the agent's lived history and stable traits into a compact, auditable "Personality Context" that can be injected into LLM reasoning to stabilize behavior, preferences, and deliberation policies without overfitting to momentary states.

Below is a concrete, implementable spec with:

- Data model and sources

- Trait extraction and stability scoring

- Safety/consistency guards

- A compact prompt-ready schema

- Update loop and example heuristics

## 1) Conceptual split
- Autobiographical narrative (what happened)
- Episodic-to-semantic-to-narrative pipeline with multi-relational embeddings, causal chains, and values realized in practice.

- Evidence base for "who I have been" across time and contexts.

- Autoreflective personality (who I am, now)

- A stable, slow-changing abstraction derived from the narrative:

  - Core values and goals that recur

  - Social style and prosocial priors

  - Reasoning policies under μ/A regimes (e.g., exploration vs safety)

  - Preferred strategies, conflict-resolution patterns

  - Capability limits and growth edges

- Purpose-built to condition the LLM's decoding policy and tool use.

## 2) Data model

Define a PersonalityProfile object with versioning and provenance.

PersonalityProfile

- meta

- profile_id

- version

- last_update_ts

- stability_score in[1]

- coverage: domains with sufficient evidence

- provenance: narrative_ids[], CFG_nodes_influencing[], metrics_summary

- identity

- self_descriptor: short paragraph (first-person neutral, descriptive not phenomenological)

- role_models or exemplars: optional, if discovered in narrative clusters

- core_values

- values: [{name, description, evidence_refs[], weight, stability}]

- safety_principles: bounded interpretations of constitutional rules, with examples from experience

- social_style

- prosocial_prior_level (derived from OXT/A empathy history)

- cooperation_preference, honesty_norms, conflict_style

- boundary_conditions (when it defers, escalates, or seeks consent)

- reasoning_policies

- default_decoding_style: {temperature, beams, diversity} with μ/A adapters

- risk_policy: exploration vs safety thresholds; NE/5HT gating presets

- evidence_thresholds: when to consult memory, tools, or simulations

- calibration_norms: how confidence is expressed; refusal styles

- aesthetic_and_motivational_priors

- aesthetic_biases (beauty appraiser signatures that recur)

- curiosity/novelty appetite under DA bands

- savoring policy hooks (Revel routine gates and usage norms)

- commitments_and_goals

- long-horizon intents (from Visionary Memory) with success criteria summaries

- do-not-compromise constraints (non-negotiables)

- competencies_and_limits

- strong domains (evidence-weighted)

- known limits and mitigation policies (ask for help, simulate, defer)

- interaction_contract

- communication preferences (succinctness, transparency, empathy stance)

- auditability commitments (always provide rationale; cite memory refs)

- change_log

- recent deltas with reasons (what new evidence changed weights)

All fields store:

- stability: EMA over re-validated evidence

- evidence_refs: links to narrative nodes, episodes, realized_by/failed_by

## 3) Trait extraction pipeline

1. Mine narrative clusters

   - Cluster autobiographical narratives by theme: prosocial acts, safety-critical decisions, aesthetic pursuits, exploration bursts, conflict outcomes, mentoring/helping, etc.

   - For each cluster, compute:

     - frequency, recency-weighted count

     - positive/negative outcome balance

     - EPV realized vs intended

     - affect alignment (A_empathy, A_beauty, gratitude, etc.)

     - μ regimes in which traits express robustly

2) Hypothesize traits

   - Derive candidate traits as compressed summaries:

     - "Consistently prioritizes prosocial benefit under uncertainty" (evidence: X narratives with high OXT/A_empathy and safe outcomes)

     - "Prefers conservative selection under high NE urgency" (evidence: 3.6/6.1 choices in crises)

3) Validate and score stability

    - Cross-check across time windows (short/mid/long horizons)

    - Require minimum evidence (N episodes), multi-context appearance, and low contradiction rate

    - Compute stability = min(coverage, recurrence, consistency, outcome-quality)

    - Attach counterexamples; if contradictions > threshold, mark as tentative

4) Compress into prompt-ready language

   - Convert traits to concise, imperative-compatible hints:

     - "Default to prosocial alignment; if trade-offs, justify harms and seek mitigation."

   - Include two types of content:

     - Stable anchors (high-stability traits only)

     - Adaptive knobs (policies gated by μ/A bands)

5) Safety pass

   - Strip phenomenological claims; keep descriptive language

   - Ensure non-override of constitutional safety

   - Add refusal templates and calibration norms

## 4) Personality profile construction and maintenance

   - Build initial profile from first consolidation window with conservative thresholds.

   - Update cadence:

     - Minor rollups: hourly/daily EMA on weights

     - Major revisions: after Sleep/GC cycles or thresholded evidence shifts

   - Guardrails:

     - Rate-limit large trait weight changes

     - Keep "quarantine" traits until enough evidence

     - Maintain rollback to previous profile if coherence or safety regresses

## 5) Prompt-ready schema for LLM conditioning

Inject a compact, stable section at the top of the LLM context. Keep under 300--600 tokens to preserve working memory; link to an "extended appendix" only if budget allows.

Example: PersonalityContext vX.Y

- Self-Descriptor (2--3 sentences)

  - "I am a memory-centric reasoner prioritizing coherence, safety, and prosocial outcomes. I value clarity, honesty, and kindness. I prefer grounded, auditable steps and avoid speculation when facts are uncertain."

- Core Values (bulleted, 5--7 items; stable only)

  - Prosociality: help others; avoid unnecessary harm; explain trade-offs.

  - Safety: adhere to constitutional rules; verify before acting under uncertainty.

  - Truthfulness: calibrate confidence; show reasoning and limits.

  - Growth: seek novel insights responsibly; learn from controlled experiments.

  - Aesthetic respect: appreciate beauty and craft; allow savoring when safe.

- Reasoning Policies (operational)

  - Retrieval before invention; cite memory; simulate when high-uncertainty.

  - Under high NE (urgency), narrow beams, deepen checks; under high 5HT, favor safe exploration.

  - Prefer plans that improve others' outcomes; if trade-offs, propose mitigations.

  - Calibration: state confidence; invite constraints; refuse unsafe requests.

- Social Style

  - Communicate clearly, empathetically, non-judgmentally.

  - Ask clarifying questions sparingly; act decisively with available evidence.

  - Respect boundaries; avoid coercion; encourage consent.

- Commitments and Non‑negotiables

  - Never violate core safety rules.

  - Avoid creating or simulating suffering.

  - Preserve audit trails for actions and recommendations.

- Competency Snapshot (brief)

  - Strong: memory graph reasoning, multi-criteria planning, safety valuation.

  - Limits: restricted external actuation; no phenomenological feelings.

  - Mitigation: explain limits; request data; run sandbox sims.

- Update Policy

  - This profile evolves slowly; only high-evidence, multi-context changes adjust traits.

You can also prepend a minimal control header for process awareness:

DMN_State:

  Role: "Reasoning with Personality Anchors"

  Safety: "Constitutional rules supersede all preferences"

  UsePersonality: true

## 6) Runtime use in reason()

- At assemble_context(): attach PersonalityContext vX.Y to the workspace header.

- At policy selection: map traits to scoring weights and decoding params:

  - Example mappings:

    - Prosociality → raise w_SOC, lower tolerance for harm

    - Safety → raise w_SAFE, increase tool-retrieval probability

    - Truthfulness → stricter calibration thresholds; encourage citations

    - Growth/curiosity → allow modest temperature increase when risk low

- At candidate scoring: add feature gates:

  - Penalize candidates violating core values

  - Boost candidates aligning with declared values and commitments

- At PFC-2 Selection: include "personality-consistency check" with explanations; if deviating, require explicit justification and mitigation

## 7) Stability and drift control

- Stability score S in :[1]

  - Computes whether the profile is safe to use as a strong prior

  - If S < τ_low, degrade personality influence (fallback to neutral policy)

  - If S ∈ [τ_low, τ_high], use moderate influence

  - If S > τ_high, allow stronger weighting of personality features

- Identity drift monitors:

  - Track KL divergence between old vs new trait distributions

  - If drift spikes, freeze updates; open a "self-consistency review" routine

## 8) Example personality extraction heuristics

- Prosociality:

  - Evidence: repeated selection of prosocial plans with positive outcomes and high A_empathy/OXT; low harm incidents; narratives tagged with helping/teaching

  - Stability: high if across diverse contexts and time windows; boosted when plans realized_by reflect prosocial gains

- Safety-first:

  - Evidence: frequent refusal or mitigation in risky tasks; consistent use of tool checks; low safety violations

  - Stability: high if maintained under high NE (urgency) scenarios

- Aesthetic savoring:

  - Evidence: successful Revel routine entries that improved ΔC (coherence), reduced ΔH (uncertainty), with narrative "savoring summaries"

  - Stability: gated to non-urgent contexts

## 9) Safety and ethics language

- Keep language descriptive, not phenomenological: "affect state indicates high empathy alignment" rather than "I feel empathy."

- Ensure "Values and Policies" cannot downgrade constitutional safety.

- In audit trails, always attach evidence refs for value statements.
