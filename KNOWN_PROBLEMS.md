## P-001: Critical Empirical Data Gap (Autobiographical Substrate Absence)
**Description**  
System lacks a persistent autobiographical narrative and identity scaffold. Thought trajectories cannot stabilize; early coherence_t and drift_t would be dominated by noise. Reasoning output remains generic and self‑references degrade to templated role statements due to insufficient episodic anchors.

## P-002: Hippocampal Expansion (HC) Disabled → Low Thought Diversity
**Description**  
Associative / hypothetical candidate expansion is absent and the episodic memory corpus is too sparse for meaningful recombination. Candidate generation risks repetitive paraphrases; novelty and exploration signals will remain low until sufficient episodic diversity exists.
