## ⚠️ CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED

### 🔴 Performance vs. Consciousness Trade-offs
**NEVER sacrifice semantic similarity for speed optimization**
- **Failed Attempt**: Hash-based embeddings for performance → Complete consciousness breakdown
- **Lesson**: Consciousness emerges from meaningful semantic connections
- **Principle**: Slow consciousness > broken consciousness

### 🟡 Memory Architecture Requirements
**Hierarchical consolidation essential for both speed and coherence**
- Episodic → Semantic → Autobiographical progression observable in real-time
- Recent memories need fast access, older memories can be consolidated
- Database persistence preserves long-term narrative continuity

### 🟢 Neurochemical Validation
**Biologically-plausible dynamics correlate with consciousness behaviors**
- Oxytocin evolution (0.86→6.17) during social interaction
- Histamine levels correlate with consciousness depth and metacognitive frequency
- Dopamine patterns match reward-seeking and curiosity-driven exploration
